# INTRODUCTION 
Conservation of energy such as lighting is considered a serious concern at national and worldwide level. Lights are usually controlled by ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ switches which are connected to 240 Volt Alternate Current (VAC). Continuous lighting in empty rooms without any occupant cost unnecessary waste of energy. In particular, the power consumption lighting in a typical house is a factor which can’t be ignored. A typical home user needs different type of light intensities at each location. Sometimes the light intensity from outside source is considered sufficient and the users do not need to turn on the light source. But there are situations where sometimes users turn on the light and leaves without turning off the light. These factors are considered one of the reasons that cause unnecessary energy wasting. Thus, indirectly causes increment in the utility cost. Therefore some alternatives are needed to control the energy conservation in a location in order to save energy and reduce the utility cost.  Due to the rising energy costs, negative energy usage and unawareness of optimization of energy usage, there is continuous effort to develop energy saving systems. Based on these facts, there are numbers of lighting management system that have been developed to reduce the energy conservat.

However, this system is said to be energy consuming because requires a computer 24-hours a day as controlling mechanism . Furthermore, this system will cost extra expenditure to users as they have to purchase a computer and special installation is required such as hardware and software integration to control the lights.

we are Desing a  Automatic Door light system (ADLS) using the pull-up resistor as a  light sensor circuit, atmega328p controller and voltmeter. This system detects Door open or close in a location to turn ‘ON’ or ‘OFF’ the controlled lights. Additionally, ADL system controls the light intensity during daylight. After operating for nine months, 50 percent energy saving was achieved compared to the previous usage 
## STRENGTHS
  1.Easier entrance and exit monitoring.
  
  2.Energy savings.
  
  3.Easy entrance and exit for materials and supplies.
  
  4.Easy entrance for people with disabilities.
  
  5.Lesser maintenance and assorted costs.
## WEAKNESSES
  1.it is not possible to control light intensity
  
  2.in day time it's not sufficient to control light.
## OPPORTUNITIES
Automatic Door light System reducing the work of beings as comapre to normal Switch circuit. Speed of this Circuit will more and saving more             electricity bill.more over cost of the system will be very less
## THREATS
competition will more in this technology and we are continuous keep updating our system and in stable in nature
